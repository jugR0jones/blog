Atkinson Hyperlegible (local install for this site)

This folder should contain the webfont files used by the site so fonts are served locally and work offline.

Recommended files (WOFF2 format):
- AtkinsonHyperlegible-Regular.woff2
- AtkinsonHyperlegible-Bold.woff2

Where to get the fonts:
- The Atkinson Hyperlegible project is available from the Braille Institute or GitHub. You can download webfont builds from:
  - https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont (official)
  - https://github.com/abegodong/atkinson-hyperlegible (community mirrors)

Place the WOFF2 files in this folder and rebuild the site. The CSS at `site/assets/css/styles.css` expects the files at:

  /assets/fonts/AtkinsonHyperlegible-Regular.woff2
  /assets/fonts/AtkinsonHyperlegible-Bold.woff2

License: Please review the font license before redistributing; Atkinson Hyperlegible is provided by the Braille Institute and has its own licensing terms.
